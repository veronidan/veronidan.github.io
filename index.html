<h1>Some Older Buildings Are More Energy-efficient than Some Newer Buildings</h1>

<h3>Older Buildings with Good Efficiency Ratings</h3>

<p>The Chrysler Building (built 1930) in New York has an EPA Energy Star rating of 84/100.  A score of at least 75 is required for a building to be considered "high efficiency".</p>

<p>The Seagram building is worse largely because all of its glass is single-glazed (i.e., one layer thick).</p>
